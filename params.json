This is not an official distribution for MapProxy and is in no way endorsed by [MapProxy](http://mapproxy.org) creators.\r\n\r\nThe aim of this installer is to make the MapProxy installation as easy, automatic and production-ready as possible on Windows based systems. During installation, it is possible to specify the data directory, server port and whether to run as a Windows service.\r\n\r\n## Download\r\nYou can download the [latest build v1.7.1 here](https://github.com/baasgeo/mapproxywindows/releases/download/1.7.1.1/MapProxy-1.7.1.1.exe) or the [installer release candidate for v1.8](https://github.com/baasgeo/mapproxywindows/releases/download/1.8.0-RC1/MapProxy-1.8.0-RC1.exe).\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\nThe installer should setup MapProxy out of the box. Just download the executable and run the wizard, the default settings are just fine. When the installation is completed, MapProxy is ready to run. Go to Start Menu -> Programs -> MapProxy 1.x.x -> Start MapProxy to start the server. \r\nThe demo page is also available at the Start Menu, MapProxy Web Admin Page.\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\nThis MapProxy uses [Portable Python](http://portablepython.com/wiki/Download/) 2.7.5 to not depend or interfere on/with other Python installations. MapProxy is configured with [CherryPy](http://www.cherrypy.org/) on top as WSGI webserver. Pywin32 is used to run MapProxy as windows service.\r\n\r\nTested as working for:\r\n- Windows 7 (32 bit)\r\n- Windows 8 (32 bit)\r\n- Windows server 2008 (64 bit)\r\n\r\nDocumentation for MapProxy is available at http://mapproxy.org/documentation.html.\r\n\r\n## How To Build\r\nFor developers wanting to improve or modify this installer, clone this repository first.\r\n\r\n    $ git clone https://github.com/baasgeo/mapproxywindows.git\r\n    $ cd MapProxyWindows\r\n\r\nMake sure you have`NSIS` and `git` installed in your system, if not, grab it at http://nsis.sourceforge.net and http://git-scm.com/download/win.\r\n\r\nNow download [Portable Python](http://portablepython.com/wiki/Download/) 2.7.5 and install the file to the `PortablePython` directory.

These files have to be downloaded before running the NSIS compiler. Get the egg files by running `easy_install` from the portable python folder and save them to the folder `eggs`.\r\n\r\n    $ PortablePython\\App\\Scripts\\easy_install -zmaxd eggs mapproxy==1.6.0 Shapely pyproj cherrypy==3.2.4\r\n\r\nNow everything is ready to for NSIS.
